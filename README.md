**Project Description**

This project employs machine learning techniques to investigate factors influencing overall survival in a diverse metastatic cancer patient cohort. It preprocesses clinical data from the MSK-MET dataset, addresses missing values, and conducts exploratory analysis on metastasis types and their relationships with demographic factors. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces dataset complexity, while feature selection techniques like SelectKBest and Mutual Information optimize it for predictive modeling. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier models are trained and evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting overall survival status. This comprehensive approach aims to develop a robust predictive model for mortality in a pan-cancer cohort, providing valuable insights for clinical prognosis in metastatic cancer patients.
